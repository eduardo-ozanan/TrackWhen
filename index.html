                <p>Welcome to TrackWhen! These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the TrackWhen mobile application (“App”) provided by the Developer (“we”, “our”, or “us”). By using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
                
                <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>1. Use of the App</h3>
                <p>The App is designed to help you organize and track personal dates and milestones—such as birthdays, anniversaries, job changes, or any other events—in an easy and secure way.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>2. Purchases and Subscriptions</h3>
                <p>The App offers two purchase options:</p>
                <p>A <b>30-day free trial</b> of the full version, after which a <b>yearly subscription</b> will begin automatically unless canceled before the trial ends. The subscription will automatically renew each year unless the user cancels it through their Apple ID account settings.</p>
                <p>A <b>one-time lifetime</b> purchase, which unlocks the full version of the App permanently with no recurring fees.</p>
                <p>All purchases are made through Apple's In-App Purchase system and are subject to Apple's terms and payment processing.</p>                
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>5. iCloud Sync</h3>
                <p>The App uses Apple iCloud to securely sync your data across devices. You must be signed in to iCloud with iCloud Drive enabled for this feature to work. This also ensures your data is preserved if you uninstall the App — it will be automatically restored when you reinstall it on the same or another device using the same iCloud account.</p>
                <p>We do not store or access your personal data. All data is stored privately on your device and in your personal iCloud account.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>6. Privacy</h3>
                <p>We take your privacy seriously. Please review our <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a> to understand how we collect and use your information.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>7. User Responsibility</h3>
                <p>You are responsible for the accuracy of the data you input. We are not liable for missed dates, incorrect reminders, or data loss due to device or iCloud issues.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>8. Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p>The App and its content are protected by copyright and other laws. You may not reproduce, modify, or distribute the App without our permission.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>9. Changes to the Terms</h3>

            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Last updated: May 17, 2024</p>

                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when using the TrackWhen mobile application ("App").</p>

                <hr>

                <h3>1. Your Data Stays Private</h3>
                <p>Your privacy is important. No personal data is collected, stored, or shared through this App.</p>
                <p>The data you enter (such as birthdays, anniversaries, and any events) is stored:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Locally on your device</li>
                    <li>And automatically synced to your personal iCloud account if iCloud Drive is enabled on your device</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This data is not accessible by the app developer or any third parties.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3>2. iCloud Sync</h3>
                <p>When iCloud Drive is enabled on your device, your data is automatically synced to your personal iCloud account. This allows you to access your data across your Apple devices using the same Apple ID.</p>
                <p>The developer does not have access to your iCloud data. All syncing and storage are handled by Apple's iCloud services.</p>
                <p>If you wish to delete your app data stored in iCloud:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open Settings on your iPhone or iPad</li>
                    <li>Tap your name at the top, then tap iCloud</li>
                    <li>Tap Manage Storage or iCloud Storage</li>
                    <li>Select TrackWhen</li>
                    <li>Tap Delete Data to remove your synced data</li>
                </ol>

                <hr>

                <h3>3. Analytics and Tracking</h3>
                <p>The App does not use analytics tools or any third-party tracking technologies.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3>4. In-App Purchases</h3>
                <p>All transactions are processed through Apple's In-App Purchase system. The developer does not collect or have access to your payment information.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3>5. Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect any personal data from children.</p>

                <hr>

                <h3>6. Your Data Rights</h3>
                <p>Since no data is collected or stored by me, you retain full control over your information. All data is stored either locally on your device or in your personal iCloud account.</p>
                <p>You can delete all app data at any time by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Deleting the app (removes local data)</li>
                    <li>Managing your iCloud storage as described above</li>
