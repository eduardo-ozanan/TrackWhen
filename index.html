            <div class="text-content">
                <p>Last updated: May 17, 2024</p>
                
                <p>Welcome to TrackWhen! These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern your use of the TrackWhen mobile application (“App”) provided by the Developer (“we”, “our”, or “us”). By using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
                
                <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>1. Use of the App</h3>
                <p>The App is designed to help you organize and track personal dates and milestones—such as birthdays, anniversaries, job changes, or any other events—in an easy and secure way.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>2. Purchases and Subscriptions</h3>
                <p>The App offers two purchase options:</p>
                <p>A <b>30-day free trial</b> of the full version, after which a <b>yearly subscription</b> will begin automatically unless canceled before the trial ends. The subscription will automatically renew each year unless the user cancels it through their Apple ID account settings.</p>
                <p>A <b>one-time lifetime</b> purchase, which unlocks the full version of the App permanently with no recurring fees.</p>
                <p>All purchases are made through Apple's In-App Purchase system and are subject to Apple's terms and payment processing.</p>                
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>5. iCloud Sync</h3>
                <p>The App uses Apple iCloud to securely sync your data across devices. You must be signed in to iCloud with iCloud Drive enabled for this feature to work. This also ensures your data is preserved if you uninstall the App — it will be automatically restored when you reinstall it on the same or another device using the same iCloud account.</p>
                <p>We do not store or access your personal data. All data is stored privately on your device and in your personal iCloud account.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>6. Privacy</h3>
                <p>We take your privacy seriously. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand how we collect and use your information.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>7. User Responsibility</h3>
                <p>You are responsible for the accuracy of the data you input. We are not liable for missed dates, incorrect reminders, or data loss due to device or iCloud issues.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>8. Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p>The App and its content are protected by copyright and other laws. You may not reproduce, modify, or distribute the App without our permission.</p>
                
                <hr>
                
                <h3>9. Changes to the Terms</h3>
                <p>These Terms may be updated occasionally. The latest version will always be available on the official website.</p>
                
                <hr>
